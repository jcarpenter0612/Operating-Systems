One operating OS is chrome, which is a google based laptop. I think this OS is more afforable in comparison to other laptops, such as Mac OS. The chrome OS can only
be used with the internet, and google based apps such as, gmail, google drive, etc.. This OS is considered to be more modified version of the linux OS. Chrome OS is unlike 
any other OS you have used before, mostly because its more restrivtive on what you can and can't used. The Chrome OS, is mostly used for the internet, music and videos.
