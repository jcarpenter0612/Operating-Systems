One function of the operating sysyem is the User Interface. This function controls the data and how specific 
informatuon shows up on the screen, keyboard and appearence of a desktop. Some user face examples include, graphic user interface,command line interface,
menu-driven user interface, touch user interface and voice user interface. For example, the graphical user interface you're 
working with menus and viusal images. 

One operating OS is chrome, which is a google based laptop. I think this OS is more afforable in comparison to other laptops, such as Mac OS. The chrome OS can only
be used with the internet, and google based apps such as, gmail, google drive, etc.. This OS is considered to be more modified version of the linux OS. Chrome OS is unlike 
any other OS you have used before, mostly because its more restrivtive on what you can and can't used. The Chrome OS, is mostly used for the internet, music and videos. 

Mac OS is one other operating system, which can be a more complex OS system then say Windows OS. MAc OS is the system that runs macbooks. I think alot of people probabley 
remember the apple computers from back in the day, and I think its safe to say Mac OS has come a long way since then. This OS is compatible with your iphone and other apple products 
as well. Mac OS is nice because you can have all your files on your phone uploaded to your macbook automaticaly. One disadvantage of Mac OS is, the system software can't be installed
on every mac.
